     *     <li>If, after the insertion, the node's capacity is still <b>SMALLER THAN OR EQUAL TO </b> the bucketing parameter,

     *
     *     <li>If, after the insertion, the node's capacity <b>SURPASSES</b> the bucketing parameter, we will have to
     *     <b>SPLIT</b> the current {@link PRQuadBlackNode} into a {@link PRQuadGrayNode} which will recursively insert
     *     all the available{@link KDPoint}s. This pprocess will continue until we reach a {@link PRQuadGrayNode}
     *     which successfully separates all the {@link KDPoint}s of the quadrant it represents. Programmatically speaking,
     *     this means that the method will polymorphically call itself, splitting black nodes into gray nodes as long as
     *     is required for there to be a set of 4 quadrants that separate the points between them. This is one of the major
     *     bottlenecks in PR-QuadTrees; the presence of a pair of {@link KDPoint}s with a very small {@link
     *     KDPoint#distanceSquared(KDPoint) distanceSquared} between them can negatively impact search in certain subplanes, because
     *     the subtrees through which those subplanes will be modeled will be &quot;unnecessarily&quot; tall.</li>

     * @param k The side length of the quadrant spanned by the <b>current</b> {@link PRQuadGrayNode}. It will need to be updated
     *           per recursive call to help guide the input {@link KDPoint} to the appropriate subtree.
